## 📖 About

**WanderLust** is inspired by AirBnb and built from scratch using the MERN-adjacent stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js, EJS). The platform lets users:

- Explore various listings.
- View detailed descriptions, locations, and images.
- Leave reviews and ratings.
- Create, update, and delete their own listings and reviews.

This project showcases my capabilities in backend logic, authentication, RESTful routing, database integration, cloud-based image handling, and full-stack deployment.
